### Project Description
[An animated digital clock that randomly changes its font, color, and character set every second, creating a visually chaotic and completely unreadable, yet captivating, time-telling experience. It's a testament to the beauty of randomness.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The ubiquity of static, boring digital clocks has led to a global epidemic of visual monotony. People are tired of seeing the time in the same predictable font and color. Our project solves this nonexistent problem by injecting chaos and joy into timekeeping, one second at a time.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created a web page that serves as an animated digital clock. Every second, it randomly selects a new font and color from a predefined list. The digits themselves are animated to appear with a smooth transition, and the entire page features a subtle, eye-catching background animation. It's a clock that's both useless and beautiful.]
