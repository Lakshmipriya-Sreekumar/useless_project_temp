### Project Description
[An animated digital clock built as a single-page web application. It displays the current time with an ever-changing font, color, and a dynamic background, making the simple act of checking the time a visually engaging and unpredictable experience.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[The ubiquity of static, boring digital clocks has led to a global epidemic of visual monotony. People are tired of seeing the time in the same predictable font and color. Our project solves this nonexistent problem by injecting chaos and joy into timekeeping, one second at a time.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We created a web page that serves as an animated digital clock. Every second, it randomly selects a new font and color from a predefined list. The digits themselves are animated to appear with a smooth transition, and the entire page features a subtle, eye-catching background animation. It's a clock that's both useless and beautiful.]
